# hw4_starter
Starter repository for UMBC CMSC 491/691 Fall 2019 HW4

You will need to install Protege on your computer and also install the pellet reasoner plugin, which you can do via the FILE menu by selecting the 'Check for plugins...' item.

You can checkout the peeps ontology from the gitHub repository https://github.com/finin/peeps.git and study it as an example.  It includes an ontology (peeps.ttl) and a file of instances (mypeeps.ttl). These can be used as examples to get you started. We recommend that you load mypeeps.owl into Protege and view the data and schema, rather than just looking at the serialization (which is in Turtle).

The HW4 repository has stubs for three files you will complete for the homework:

* hw4ontology.owl
* hw4data.owl
* documentation.md
